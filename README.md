# Boustrophedonic-List

Boustrophedonic - Greek word: A method of writing shown in early Greek inscriptions, in which the lines run alternately from right to left and from left to right, as the furrows made in plowing a field, the plow passing alternately backward and forward.
This project is based off of a node structure where each node has North, South, East, West pointers, but can only be linked in the Boustrophedonic format. This was created from a class project<sup>1</sup> (Optomized C++).
